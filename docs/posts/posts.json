    "contents": "\nFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse, an 1887 painting by Viktor Vasnetsov\nSo you want to change your curriculum, you may even want to be innovative and change everything, assessment, course sequence, type of delivery, calendar, degree requirements. Everything.\nWell, before you start dreaming, brainstorming with post-its, and drawing on a whiteboard with multiple colors, there are four gates, four checkpoints, four horsemen that will send your little innovative ideas to the apocalypse.\nYou cannot ignore them, if you do not abide by them you must at least have an answer about how to defeat it. They work as control checkpoints or valves. They slow down the process, sometimes for a good reason, because any significant change in the curriculum has a lasting impact to the institution and to the future of our students.\nSo here they are, Death, Famine, War, and Conquest\nHorseman 1. Death: Admission requirements for graduate and professional schools.\nWill our courses be accepted elsewhere? Will they transfer in and transfer out? The moment your courses do not have the name or the exact content or the prescribed number of credits, they may not be accepted elsewhere. It is not uncommon to not be transfer friendly among undergraduate degrees, specially for courses in the major. But there is another way to be transfer unfriendly, and that is if professional and graduate schools do not recognize our courses. This is specially problematic when many of our students pursue a post-graduate career. Not paying attention to this problem may undermine students career forever.\nAdvice\nMake a decision early and be aware of it. Unless your institution has a brand (Stanford courses will be accepted everywhere) there will be schools who will not recognize your courses.\nUsually not being transfer friendly lowers the number of applying students. Bring the “Admissions department” to the conversation, they may not be too happy. Give them information and materials to help them “sell” your innovative curriculum.\nConsult with student counselors and academic coaches. What do they think? Are we really undermining our students long-term careers?\nTalk to professional and graduate schools ahead of time. Possibly making minor changes to the curriculum (changing course names, or adding a pre-req) may make your courses more transfer friendly.\nHorseman 2. Famine: Calendar and scheduling challenges\nYou may have thought about “block scheduling”, or limiting sections to 10 people, or perhaps starting your semester earlier or perhaps having all students take the same chemistry lab during the same week. While there may be a pedagogically justified reason for your innovation it may be hindered by the following realities 1. Financial Aid and calendar stiffness. 2. Number of staff skilled, available and willing to teach it. 3. Number of special rooms or labs available at a given time.\nAdvice\nThese problems revolve around money. Just be aware of how much money you have for your innovations.\nHorseman 3. War: Faculty buy in. Whip your votes.\nThe same way that it is not bad that there are systems in place to slow down any curriculum change, it is not bad either that faculty may be skeptical or may require convincing. That being said, it is also important to recognize that not everyone will be on board. Be always careful with members who will keep vocalizing opposition, if not by votes, by volume and repetition. The tyranny of the loudest usually undermines the morale of the many.\nAdvice\nCount your votes before putting a motion on the floor. Designate a whip. Listen and be ready to compromise\nBe transparent: Perhaps create a site or a FAQ answering the questions to all the worse case scenarios. Always control your message and do not let unanswered questions linger.\nIt doesn’t matter how right you think you are, unless you are going to create a parallel department, do not think you can carry on without a significant buy-in of the faculty.\nHorseman 4. Conquest: Leaving students behind.\nOften, curriculum innovations are motivated by pedagogy. You want your students to learn better, learn more, transfer, apply, do research, hands-on experience. In other words, you want your students to practice what is called “high-order cognitive skills” as early as possible. Problem solving is a high-order cognitive skill. Having taught first-years I learned that there’s a significant portion of our cohort who are not ready to engage in high-order activities, the cause may be many, as many as they may be described in the books about student success: mental health, socioeconomic pressures, studying skills, work ethics, academic preparation…\nAdvice\nUnless you “play safe” and become a fairly exclusive institution by not admitting students under certain academic performance there are two possibilities ahead:\nMaximizing the number of students on board which will minimize true problem-solving or any other high-order cognitive skill\nReal experience, hands-on, true problem-solving which will leave some students behind.\nThis last option is specially delicate with internships in the community and private sector. Will they be carefully planned? Any placement process? Otherwise, putting an unprepared student in a “real” environment, will not only be detrimental to the student education, but to the relationship with the community partner.\n\n\n\n",

We are analyzing here the results of implementing the open ended assessments as they had been described in “Establishing open-ended assessments: investigating the validity of creative exercises” SE Lewis, JL Shaw, KA Freeman - Chem. Educ. Res. Pract., 2011, 12, 158-166 (https://doi.org/10.1039/C1RP90020J)\nDuring these “open Ended questions” (OE) students are asked to name 5 relevant statements about a topic. Students had practiced similar questions at the beginning of each class session. During the three semester exams they were asked to name five relevant things about certain topics. For example:\nExam 1: Given a table of “Mass atom” and “Natural abundance” for two unknown elements they were asked “Below are shown the isotopic breakdown of 2 different elements. Make 5 relevant statements about these two samples”\n\nExam 2: Make 5 relevant and true statements about the organic compound shown below. CH3CH(CH3)CH2CHO\nExam 3: Given three skeletal structures of biomolecules “Make 5 relevant and true statements about the three molecules below”\n\nAnalysis\nLet’s load the data and clean it up a little bit. All the information is in the “all” dataframe\n\n\nShow code\n\nsetwd(\"~/Gd/Research/OpenEnded5relevantThings/\")\n \n#Load grades\ngrades <- read.csv(\"./chem1331grades_f19_new.csv\",header=TRUE)\n#load gradescope results for Exam1, 2, and 3\nopend1 <- read.csv(\"./Ex1_f19_1_5_things.csv\",header=TRUE)\nopend2 <- read.csv(\"./Ex2_f19_1_5_Things.csv\",header=TRUE)\nopend3 <- read.csv(\"./Ex3_f19_1_5_Things.csv\",header=TRUE)\n#Merge the whole thing into on DF\nall = merge(opend1,opend2, by=\"Email\",all=TRUE)\nall = merge(all,opend3, by=\"Email\",all=TRUE)\nall = merge(all,grades, by=\"Email\",all=TRUE)\nrownames(all) <- all$Email\nall$Email <- NULL\n#calcualate mean score in OE and create a new column\nall$meanOE = rowMeans(subset(all,select = c(\"Score.x\",\"Score.y\",\"Score\")),na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\nOverall O.E. grade distribution\nOn a total grade of 5 points, if we average the score of each student over exam 1, 2, and 3 we can see that most students obtain an average between 2.5 and 4.\n\n\nShow code\n\n#plot the average vs final grade\nhist(all$meanOE, main=\"Average grade of Op End in Exam 1,2,3\")\n\n\n\n\nCorrelating performance in O.E. and course grades\nIf we plot performance in O.E. vs final grades we obtain a significant positive correlation\n\n\nShow code\n\n#remove students who dont have a final grade\nallNAfinal = all[!is.na(all$MAX),]\nplot(allNAfinal$meanOE,allNAfinal$MAX, main = \"Final course grade vs OE avg score\")\nr2<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$MAX)\nabline(lm(allNAfinal$MAX~ allNAfinal$meanOE))\nlegend(x='bottomright',legend=paste(\"Cor=\",round(r2,4)))\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find for other grade categories that correlate better with O.E. than final grades. For obvious reasons, the highest correlation is with the open ended written exams as the O.E. questions are part of it.\n\n\nShow code\n\nr2finalexam<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$Final.Exam )\nr2written<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$OpenEnded )\nr2finalLab<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$LabFinal )\nr2HW<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$HW )\nr2Report<-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$Report.. )\nr2Prelab <-cor(allNAfinal$meanOE, allNAfinal$Prelab.. )\nr2table <- data.frame(\"Final grade\" = c(r2), \"Final Exam\" = c(r2finalexam), \"Writen Exams\"= c(r2written), \"Lab final\" = c(r2finalLab), \"Homework\" = c(r2HW), \"Lab reports\" = c(r2Report), \"Prelab\" = c(r2Prelab)  )\nkable(r2table)\n\n\nFinal.grade\nFinal.Exam\nWriten.Exams\nLab.final\nHomework\nLab.reports\nPrelab\n0.618099\n0.5305522\n0.747087\n0.4978805\n0.2553626\n0.1902491\n0.0019672\n\nLetter grades groups and performance in OE\nWe can analyze the performance in OE for different letter grades.

Notice that the correlation in both types of mistakes is, as expected, negative, which means that the higher the number of mistakes the lower the performance in the course.\n\n\nShow code\n\nr2<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$MAX )\nr2finalexam<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$Final.Exam )\nr2written<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$OpenEnded )\nr2finalLab<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$LabFinal )\nr2HW<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$HW )\nr2Report<-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$Report.. )\nr2Prelab <-cor(allNAfinal$notTrue, allNAfinal$Prelab.. )\nr2table <- data.frame(\"Final grade\" = c(r2), \"Final Exam\" = c(r2finalexam), \"Writen Exams\"= c(r2written), \"Lab final\" = c(r2finalLab), \"Homework\" = c(r2HW), \"Lab reports\" = c(r2Report), \"Prelab\" = c(r2Prelab)  )\nkable(r2table, caption=\"Correlation with Not True mistakes\")\n\n\nTable 1: Correlation with Not True mistakes\nFinal.grade\nFinal.Exam\nWriten.Exams\nLab.final\nHomework\nLab.reports\nPrelab\n-0.5063556\n-0.4116678\n-0.637651\n-0.4290181\n-0.2054091\n-0.1721591\n-0.0044984\n\nShow code\n\nplot(allNAfinal$notTrue,allNAfinal$MAX, main = \"Final course grade vs Not true mistakes\")\nabline(lm(allNAfinal$MAX~ allNAfinal$notTrue))\nlegend(x='bottomright',legend=paste(\"Cor=\",round(r2,4)))\n\n\n\n\nAnd this table is with “Not relevant” mistakes\n\n\nShow code\n\nr2<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$MAX )\nr2finalexam<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant , allNAfinal$Final.Exam )\nr2written<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$OpenEnded )\nr2finalLab<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$LabFinal )\nr2HW<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$HW )\nr2Report<-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$Report.. )\nr2Prelab <-cor(allNAfinal$notRelevant, allNAfinal$Prelab.. )\nr2table <- data.frame(\"Final grade\" = c(r2), \"Final Exam\" = c(r2finalexam), \"Writen Exams\"= c(r2written), \"Lab final\" = c(r2finalLab), \"Homework\" = c(r2HW), \"Lab reports\" = c(r2Report), \"Prelab\" = c(r2Prelab)  )\nkable(r2table, caption=\"Correlation with Not True mistakes\")\n\n\nTable 2: Correlation with Not True mistakes\nFinal.grade\nFinal.Exam\nWriten.Exams\nLab.final\nHomework\nLab.reports\nPrelab\n-0.2034072\n-0.2341019\n-0.1863573\n-0.1541022\n-0.0451623\n-0.007477\n0.0414387\n\nShow code\n\nplot(allNAfinal$notRelevant,allNAfinal$MAX, main = \"Final course grade vs Not Relevant mistakes\")\nabline(lm(allNAfinal$MAX~ allNAfinal$notRelevant))\nlegend(x='bottomright',legend=paste(\"Cor=\",round(r2,4)))\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIt does make sense that performance in Open Ended assessments correlates positively with all the grade categories in the course. As for the types of mistakes, making “not true” mistakes in these type of questions correlates better with performance in the course.\n\n\n\n",
