During the first weeks of the pandemic I decided to teach some basic historical events in human (western) civilization.

I know nothing about how to teach History, but it seems to me that while the analysis of historical events will always be
more important than remembering facts, there has to be a minimum of memorization. Every functioning citizen should be able
to place the important events in a timeline.

So I wrote a silly drag and drop interactive page using the [jQuery](https://jquery.com) library to give my kids a sense of accomplishment while they memorize this stuff.
